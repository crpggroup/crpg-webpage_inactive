With the increasing digitalization of power grids, the Cyber-Physical power Systems are extensively studied. However, given the national security concerns, detailed information about Cyber-Physical power Systems (CPS) cannot be publicly disclosed, i.e., power grid models, communication network architectures, and data. Also, standard test systems for CPS are missing in the current literature. Under such background, synthetic networks emerge as a promising method to generate fictitious but realistic projections of power grids and communication networks. A synthetic CPS avoids revealing sensitive network models and data while providing reliable test networks for research. This demo presents the synthetic CPS model of the interconnected power grids in continental Europe generated by CRPG.

Electrical power grids are vulnerable to cyber attacks, as seen in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016. However, existing attack detection methods are limited. Most of them are based on power system measurement anomalies that occur when an attack is successfully executed at the later stages of the cyber kill chain. In contrast, the attacks on the Ukrainian power grid show the importance of system-wide, early-stage attack detection through communication-based anomalies. Therefore, in this demo, we propose a novel method for online cyber attack situational awareness that enhances the power grid resilience. It supports power system operators in the identification and localization of active attack locations in Operational Technology (OT) networks in near real-time. The proposed method employs a hybrid deep learning model of Graph Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (GC-LSTM) and a deep convolutional network for time series classification-based anomaly detection. It is implemented as a combination of software defined networking, anomaly detection in communication throughput, and a novel attack graph model.
