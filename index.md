# Cyber Resilient Power Grids
<hr>
<hr>


### Our Mission

It is our mission to develop innovative solutions that enhance the security, resilience, and optimal performance of Cyber-Physical Power Systems (CPS). The Cyber Resillient Power Grids (CRPG) research group covers various areas, including CPS modelling, cyber security, digital twin technology, next-generation grid operation, and self-healing grids. We are aiming at building a cutting-edge laboratory that can provide reliable and advanced simulation infrastructure for CPS, which will be of great significance to cope with the evolving threats in modern smart grids.

### Our Story
On 1st October 2021, the Control Room of the Future (CRoF) was opened in TU Delft’s Electrical Sustainable Power Lab. This ultramodern control room can simulate any disruption to the power grid in a controlled research environment, from lightning strikes to cyberattacks. In the Control Room of the Future, simulating a cyberattack on the power grid is a piece of cake. “We will show you how we research cybersecurity”, says Alex Stefanov, assistant professor in Intelligent Electrical Power Grids at TU Delft's Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science.
