# Cyber Resilient Power Grids
<hr>
<hr>


### Our Mission

It is our mission to develop innovative solutions that enhance the security, resilience, and optimal performance of Cyber-Physical Power Systems (CPS). The Cyber Resillient Power Grids (CRPG) research group covers various areas, including CPS modelling, cyber security, digital twin technology, next-generation grid operation, and self-healing grids. We are aiming at building a cutting-edge laboratory that can provide reliable and advanced simulation infrastructure for CPS, which will be of great significance to cope with the evolving threats in modern smart grids.
