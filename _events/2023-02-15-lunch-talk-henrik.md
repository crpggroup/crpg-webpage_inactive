Following a quick introduction of SBOMs, Henrik will present the results of a case-study that comprised running three 
SBOM generators at different times of the software development lifecycle. The results show that the quality/accuracy of 
generated SBOMs greatly varies from one tool and one lifecycle phase to another, and are hardly comparable across SBOM.
