**Abstract:**

The success of Deep Neural Networks with image classification prompted
researchers to explore the applications of Deep Learning in Medical
Imaging and Medical Image Analysis (MIA). Deep Neural Networks have
sufficiently demonstrated their capabilities of performing MIA tasks
tirelessly and with fewer errors as opposed to their human
counterpart. However the challenge of training neural networks using
sensitive medical data, without violating the privacy of patients
remains an active field of research. Many solutions exist to address
this concern, however a systematic review and analysis of these
techniques is yet to be conducted. This paper attempts to conduct the
first systematic review of privacy-preserving techniques to train deep
learning models. Emphasis is especially put on the performance and
privacy analysis of the techniques. In addition, the communication and
runtime costs, the ability of the solutions to scale, tolerance to
faults and the level of security against threats and attacks are also
studied.
