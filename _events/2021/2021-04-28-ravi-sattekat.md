**Abstract:**

Quantum Software Development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, and testing executable quantum programs that are meant to run on practical quantum hardware. Even though Quantum Software Development research has gained traction over the years, it is still mainly focused on problem analysis, language design, and implementation. Software testing, which is the process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding failures, and verifying that the software product is fit for use is yet to receive substantial attention in quantum software development. This talk covers the progress of my Master's Thesis that answers the question of to what extent we can use classical testing techniques in the quantum domain, how would an application independent quantum testing framework look like, and how practical is it with the current state of physical hardware. Using the principles of Spectrum based Fault Localisation, we show that we are able to properly detect and localise bugs in the State Teleportation Application, even in the presence of noise in the hardware.
