Dear all,

Join us on February the 12th, 14:00 - 15:00 on Zoom for the next **SERG Reading Club** 📖📚!
We're reviewing one of our internal papers or an exemplar paper against the [ACM SIGSOFT Empirical Standards](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards).

The paper for this session is from Amir Mir:
"Type4Py: Deep Similarity Learning-Based Type Inference for Python"

you can find it on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04470)

See you there 👋🏼😄
