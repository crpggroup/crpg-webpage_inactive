Dear all,

Join us on April the 30th, 14:00 - 15:00 on Zoom for the next **SERG Reading Club** ðŸ“–ðŸ“š!

We're reading: [Utilizing a Journal Club to Build Research Competencies in a Cross-Disciplinary Environment](https://src-online.ca/index.php/src/article/view/337)

Some quotes to give an impression:

"The goal of this process-focused field note is to detail the steps taken to design and implement the pilot of a cross-disciplinary research-trainee-led journal club within a hospital-based research institute."

"Recommendations for institutes interested in the implementation of similar programs focused on research competencies within a cross-disciplinary setting are given."
