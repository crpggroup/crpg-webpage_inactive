As we all know, software testing is a critical part of the software engineering process. However, testing comes with its own set of challenges and problems. To this end, we have developed TestKnight, a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that helps developers test their code.

Some of the features provided by TestKnight are:

- Quick test method duplication and adjustment
- Testing checklist generation based on structural and black-box testing
- Assertion suggestion
- Visualization of coverage changes

TestKnight was developed as part of the CSE2000 Software Project course. This presentation is also part of the course and will be held on Zoom.
