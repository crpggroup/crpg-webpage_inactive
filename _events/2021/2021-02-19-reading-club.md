Dear all,

Join us on February the 19th, 14:00 - 15:00 on Zoom for the next **SERG Reading Club** ðŸ“–ðŸ“š!
We're reviewing one of our internal papers or an exemplar paper against the [ACM SIGSOFT Empirical Standards](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards).

The paper for this session is from Carolin and about developer-friendly test amplification. ðŸ˜„
It's unpublished, so please ask Carolin for the pdf.
The standards to evaluate against are the general standards and "Qualitative Surveys (Interview Studies)".

Wanna join & you are not part of our Mattermost?
