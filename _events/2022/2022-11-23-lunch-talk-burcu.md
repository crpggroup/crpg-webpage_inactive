***Abstract***

The Probabilistic Concurrency Testing (PCT) algorithm provides nontrivial theoretical guarantees on the probability of detecting concurrency bugs. 
In this talk, I will provide an overview of the PCT algorithm, which is designed for sequentially consistent multithreaded programs [1], our extension of PCT to testing distributed systems [2], and, more recently, to weak memory concurrency [3], which allows a wider set of concurrency behaviors than sequential consistency.
