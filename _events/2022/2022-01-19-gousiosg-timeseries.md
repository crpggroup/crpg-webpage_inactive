**Abstract:**

Timeseries are series of measurements indexed by time. They are a fundamendal data structure for data science, 
and the bread and butter of many mature fields, like econometrics or physics.
In our talk, we will explore what types of analysis we can do by combining timeseries with machine learning
and present 2 use cases where we applied ML on multivariate timeseries signals to solve software engineering problems.
