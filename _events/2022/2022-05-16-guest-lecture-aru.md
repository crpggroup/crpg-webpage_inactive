In this lecture, I will talk about data validation for ML. The first
half of the lecture will be a presentation, topics include *What* is
data validation, *Why* should we validate our data & *How* we can
validate data.

The second half of the lecture will be a hands on tutorial on how we
can use [Tensorflow Data Validation] to validate our data. If you are
interested in following along with the tutorial, please bring your
laptop to the lecture. Finally make sure to follow the [setup
instructions] **prior** to the tutorial.

You can attend the lecture physically at [Pulse Hall 7] or attend
virtually (contact Aru on mattermost for the link). Hope to see you
there!
