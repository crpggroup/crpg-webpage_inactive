***Abstract***

Sustained exponential advances in computing power, drops in associated
costs, and Open Science initiatives allow us to process on a
personal computer the metadata from most major international academic
publishers. Alexandria3k is an open-source software library and tool
that builds on this capability to allow the conduct of sophisticated
bibliometric and scientometric studies as well as systematic literature
reviews in a transparent, repeatable, reproducible, and efficient manner.
In total the Alexandria3k system provides relational access to 1.5 PB of
data comprising 2.6 billion records.  Diverse examples demonstrate the
system's use through ad hoc queries and the population of domain-specific
databases.
