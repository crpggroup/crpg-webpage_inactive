**Abstract:**

Search-Based Software Engineering is now a mature area with numerous techniques developed to tackle some of the most challenging software engineering problems, from requirements to design, testing, fault localisation, and automated program repair. SBSE techniques have shown promising results, giving us hope that one day it will be possible for the tedious and labour intensive parts of software development to be completely automated, or at least semi-automated. In this talk, I will focus on the problem of objective performance evaluation of SBSE techniques. To this end, I will introduce Instance Space Analysis (ISA), which is an approach to identify features of SBSE problems that explain why a particular instance is difficult for an SBSE technique. ISA can be used to examine the diversity and quality of the benchmark datasets used by most researchers, and analyse the strengths and weaknesses of existing SBSE techniques. The instance space is constructed to reveal areas of hard and easy problems, and enables the strengths and weaknesses of the different SBSE techniques to be identified. I will present on how ISA enabled us to identify the strengths and weaknesses of SBSE techniques in two areas: Search-Based Software Testing and Automated Program Repair. Finally, I will end my talk with future directions of the objective assessment of SBSE techniques.
