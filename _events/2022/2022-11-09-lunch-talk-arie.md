***Abstract***

Starting September 1st, 2022, I have been appointed by the cabinet of the Dutch government as a member of the Advisory Council ICT Assessments ([AcICT](https://www.adviescollegeicttoetsing.nl/)). In this presentation, I give an overview of the responsibilities of this council, and share my first impressions.

For background, I refer to my [blogpost](https://avandeursen.com/2022/08/15/member-advisory-council-ict-assessments/).
