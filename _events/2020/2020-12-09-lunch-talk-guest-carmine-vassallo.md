**Abstract:** Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice that enables developers to build reliable software faster. Given its proven benefits, most organizations have started adopting CI and fostered the application of several principles, such as commit often, that reduce conflicts in the team and ensure that the build is continuously executable. However, when facing a deadline or a difficult task, developers can deviate from such best practices and follow anti-patterns, which are ineffective solutions to recurrent problems. Anti-patterns appear to be beneficial, but, in the end, they let CI decay and lower its effectiveness. In this talk, I will present our approaches for making developers aware of CI anti-patterns and their severity through the static and dynamic analysis of their CI pipelines.
