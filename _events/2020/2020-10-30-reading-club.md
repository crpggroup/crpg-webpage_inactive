Dear all,

For this Friday we want to dive deeper into industry-academia collaborations. What is the state of collaborations? Do the partners benefit from the joint projects? how could we increase the process of collaborations between academia and industry?

Join us on October the 30th, 13:00 - 14:00 on Zoom for the next **SERG Reading Club** ðŸ“–ðŸ“š!:

**"Characterizing industry-academia collaborations in software engineering: evidence from 101 projects"** by  Garousi et al.
