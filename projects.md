<div style="text-align: justify"> CRPG is exploring various ways of achieving cyber resiliency including the development of new methods to detect cyber-attacks, the integration of new technologies into the power grid system, and the enhancement of power grid modeling to diagnose and manage system vulnerabilities. The research group is also exploring ways to educate power system operators and stakeholders on the importance of cyber resilience, including the dissemination of best practices, case studies, and hands-on training programs. With the significant advances in technology and the increasing complexity of the power grid, the Cyber Resilient Power Grids research group's work is more important than ever before to ensure the safe, reliable, and resilient operation of modern power systems. </div>
