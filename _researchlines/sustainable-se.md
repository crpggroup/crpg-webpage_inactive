Sustainable software engineering can be divided into five major dimensions: Technical, Economical,
**Individual**, **Social**, and **Environmental**.

Throughout the history of Software Engineering, we have witnessed a number of advancements in the
way software systems are conceived. The software industry is now able to have business models and
development practices that help continuously improve and maintain software products in the long run.

ðŸŒ± **We need Greener Software.**

Nevertheless, these advancements have been targeting mostly the **technical** and **economical**
dimensions. In fact, these are the main perspectives used to analyze healthy software businesses.
There are however very important dimensions that have been overlooked: **individual**, **social**, and
**environmental**. In this research line, we give the spotlight to these three dimensions with a big
emphasis on **Environmental Sustainability**.

ðŸŒ±  **We also need Greener AI.**

Our concern includes, of course, AI. The advancement of learning techniques has been solely looking into
generating better and more accurate prediction models. For our comfort, the usage of
computation-intensive resources has been hidden behind the walls of big cloud servers. However, one
cannot disregard their footprint in our environment.


A number of projects are starting to emerge to promote **Green Software**:

- [Principles.Green]. Principles of Sustainable Software Engineering.
- [Energy Patterns for Mobile Apps]. In this project, we collect and reusable solutions for recurrent energy-efficiency problems in iOS and Android applications.
- [Leafactor]. Automatic refactoring for energy-efficiency.
- [Awesome Mobile App Energy Papers]. A curated list of academic papers on the energy-efficiency of mobile applications.
- [ML CO2 Impact]. A tool to estimate Machine Learning carbon footprints.

### How to get involved?

We are looking for enthusiastic students that are willing to push the boundaries of sustainable software engineering.
